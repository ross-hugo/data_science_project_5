This is a project using time series forecasting to determine the demand for a particular product

Project 5 - World Wide Products Inc. 

In this project we try and predict the demand of a product in the future, focusing on time series analysis.

Findings/Results:

I was very happy with the results of this project. I thought that by not using a complex model, like a highly fine tuned LSTM, I would achieve low results. Since there were many products in the data set, I iterated over all and fit and tested the respective models to each product and took the average of the total scores. Yes, most of the average scores were negative, but there was one model that outperformed the rest being Gradient Boost. If I were to do this project again, I would have tried to tackle more complex models and also have focused on specific time periods which would have proved more fruitful
